## Tagline
Experience the with cutting-edge technology: Blockchain and Augmented Reality in the Digital Museum Marketplace - Ensuring Security to Archaeologists



## Problem it solves
We know that archaeology has an extremely important role in connecting the current generation and the ever changing world to its origin, tracing back its evolution and even unlocking the mysteries of the ancient time, their cultures and practices too. But in this ever changing time, people focus on gaining wealth and popularity on the exploitation and expense of others, hence, influencing the current organizations to benefit them, taking the advantage of being on a wealthier archaelogist and exploiting the budding ones. So, to protect the authentic discoverer of the artifacts, we have built a museum marketplace.

Based on blockchain, it decentralizes and brings transparency between the discoverer and the masses (people) to recognize the real person behind the finding and hence motivating him to persue his job with diligence. It even incentivizes the archaeologist as well as the museum based on crowdfunding, hence encouraging the archaeologist as well as the museum to preserve the invaluable artifacts too.

Also, it provides an initial experience of Augmented Reality with the help of Echo3D models by which people from anywhere in the world can get the real time experience of the artifacts as if they are physically present there.



## Challenges we ran into
During the development of this project, We have faced several challenges like Integrating Hardhat, Solidity. We had to manage the time effectively and ensuring that the project has to be prototyped on time was a challenge task for us. 



## What we learned
We learned about many different sponsered technologies that we actually found useful during project development.
